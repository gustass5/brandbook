							To expand the brand awareness of Fontys ICT InnovationLab
							outside Strijp TQ, there is been looked at the dynamic
							possibilities with the logo for Social Media. Taking the in
							advance decided dynamic elements of the logo into account,
							there is been made a static but dynamic design for the
							Instagram of InnovationLab. The on research based designs
							have been put together which gives an example of how the
							Social Media of Fontys ICT InnovationLab could look like.

						<h1 className="text-3xl">Dynamic tabs</h1>
						<p>
							According to research, a Social media page should reflect
							the brand and have a recognizable style. This way it will
							strengthen te engagement with visitors and improves brand
							awareness. To combine the logo/brand and the dynamic wish
							with static photos, this photo filter has been designed. The
							tab can be changed into the subject if the post, using the
							black or white background and the Fontys Fruitiger font.
						</p>

						<h1 className="text-3xl">Profile image</h1>
						<p>
							The Fontys ICT InnovationLab logo is a long logo with
							different elements. When the whole logo is used as image,
							especially the Fontys ICT part will not be readable. So to
							create a recognizable and readable profile picture without
							changing the elements, the lab part has been used as image.
							Because of the dots, it will still be linked with the
							company.
